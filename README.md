Hi, I’m Ro, otherwise known here as rn-view. 

I’m currently a fellow in health research, and my current project deals with population health data. 

Although my experience with data is limited and very novice, I’m currently learning R for this fellowship. I hope to track my proficiency here. So this will be like a portfolio of sorts.

I'd appreciate any feedback on how to best approach the statistical probelms I may face in R. Thanks!
